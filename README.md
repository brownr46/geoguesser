# COMP 426 Final Project: GeoGuesser

Here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xI6MSvCspQ) to the video explaining my project. 

It is currently live via Firebase Hosting [here](https://geoguesser-ca064.web.app/).

# Achievements Attempted

* Beginner's Luck: I used Mapillary's API to search for viable street view locations and then retrieve the images. 
* Now we're cooking: I used the Google Maps Javacript API for the location picker and to calculate distances as well as their Geocoding API to translate between geographic coordinates and place names. 
* There's something about Firebase: I used Firebase for user authentication as well as Firestore to keep track of the leaderboard.
* rEnder it: It's a game.
* It's a friblork: Project was built with React.
